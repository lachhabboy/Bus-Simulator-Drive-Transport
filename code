Don’t worry if you miss something, though – your tasks are listed on the right-hand side of the screen as a reminder.
                    Your first task will be to choose your starter bus. Yes, just like Pokemon, there are three choices and you only get to take one. You can capture, er, I mean, buy the other buses later on in the game when you’ve got the cash. But for now, just choose whichever one takes your fancy. It doesn’t really matter which one you choose. What does matter is getting the engines started. It’s not as simple as just pulling R2 and zipping away.
                    How to start the engine in Bus Simulator 21:
                    Press left on the d-pad to bring up the radial menu.
                    Navigate to the engine icon at the top of the wheel and press X (A on Xbox)

                    Others will stop at your cabin to buy a ticket. You’ll need to sell them a ticket quickly before you can get the bus moving. The key here is to pay attention to what is being asked and to do it quickly. There are only a few ticket options so it’s fairly straightforward. But be warned, mistakes will cost you and they’ll eat into your profits. Not by much mind, you, so don’t worry about handing out too much change… Here’s how to sell tickets in Bus Simulator 21.
